Using `#` signs to make the text bigger, format the readme so it has the repository name as a heading, and the standard subheadings \"Description\", \"Usage\", \"Installation\", and \"Examples\" (similar to the \"What is it?\" and \"Where to get it?\" subheadings in the [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) readme).  \n\n  - Add a text file called `main.py`.  Add in the following code: `print('hi')`. Commit the file (bottom of the screen) with the message \"prints hello\".\n\n  - Edit the file, adding the line `print('goodbye')`, and commit the change with the message \"also print goodbye\"\n\n  - Check the list of commits in your repo.

The workflow in GitHub usually follows 3 steps:\n\n  1. **Raise an Issue**: Check to see if the maintainer of the project are aware of the problem you found already, and if not, post a description in the \"Issues\" forum.\n  2. **Fork the Project**: Make a copy of the project, so you can try out a solution.\n  3. **Make a Pull Request**: Once you've made a fix, you can ask the maintainer to \"pull\" the changes from your project into theirs.  If they accept (usually after some discussion), then you'll have made a contribution to their project! \n\nMost of these features can be found in the tabs lining the top of each repo.

Once a workflow file is included in the repository, GitHub Actions will automatically run the code whenever a criterion you set (for example, whenever a new commit is made).  GitHub provides a lot of prepared templates for common workflows to get us started.  For exapmle:\n\n  - Installing and Testing that a python package works for different python versions.\n\n  - Publishing a new release of a Python package to users whenever a feature was added.\n\n  - Checking that the code has the correct syntax and looks professional (\"linting\" code)\n\n\n![actions](imgs/github_actions.png)","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"b61ccd1ad2484dd4829c4c5724ccc4b0","source_hash":"c2ff433e","execution_start":1649285058004,"execution_millis":0,"deepnote_cell_height":865.765625,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Exercises\n\n  - [ ] In your fork of the project, set up a PyLint workflow.

Do you really need to make a whole foler (i.e., a repository) to do that?  **\"Gists\"** are tiny repositories (usually a single file).  Gists don't support most features of GitHub, but for single files that usually doesn't matter: people can read the code, comment on it, make web links to specific lines of code (useful in online discussions), and even submit changes to gists. \n\nTo create a Gist, The \"New Gist\" button is found under the + button on the upper-right corner of the website.\n\n![add gist button](imgs/github_gistadd.jpg)\n\nThis gives you a text editor, where you can add a file description, filename, and the text itself:\n\n![gist editor](imgs/github_gistedit.jpg)\n\n\n#### Exercises\n\nCreate a gist for the \"number guesser game\" in Python (below), `guess_number.py`, and get a link to line 10 of the script.\n\n```python\nimport random\ntarget_num = random.randint(1, 10)\nprint(\"Hi!
